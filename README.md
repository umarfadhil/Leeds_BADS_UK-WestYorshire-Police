# Leeds_BADS_UK-WestYorshire-Police

## Introduction

This is my first R task during my Master's study. The file contains UK Data Police in West Yorkshire about street criminal crimes from Jan 2020 - Sep 2021, and the objective of this task is to find interesting facts within this data. After finding them, I have to visualise and explain them on three slides of PowerPoint. The scope of this task depends on the students. Either can be narrow-deep analysis (only analyse one month in one city) or wide-surface analysis (explore the macro information the whole year in all cities). In this task, I used mixed, from general to specific analysis.


## Structure

#### 1. The Number of Crime Cases in  West Yorkshire and Leeds During Covid-19 (Lockdown and Relaxation of Restrictions' Effect)
#### 2. The Changes of Number Crime Types in Peaks-Valleys
#### 3. Mapping Area for Specific Crime Types that Happened Significantly


## Conclusions

- Lockdown made the number of streel level crimes in West Yorkshire and Leeds decrease significantly and touched the all-time low in the given period. However, the statements that authorisation made about lifting it made the number of crimes rocketing until they reached their peak one month after the lockdown was completely deployed. West Yorkshire and Leeds had the same pattern throughout the period.

- Violence and sex offences were the most affected crime type about this effect by its number of cases.

- The number of Drugs cases increased during 1st lockdown by 30% 

- The number of Theft (Bicycle Theft and Shoplifting) cases spiked after the government relaxing the restrictions by 50% and 100% respectively

- Crime-prone locations (students should be aware of):
    1. Violence and sex offences --> City Centre, Beeston Hill, Hyde Park, Harehills, East End Park
    2. Bicycle Theft --> Beeston, Beeston Hill, Harehills
    3. Drugs --> City Centre
